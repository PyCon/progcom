Dear {{name}},

Thank you very much for your PyCon 2017 talk proposal,
"{{title}}".

Unfortunately, your talk was not one of the ones selected to appear at
PyCon 2017.

Each year brings more talk submissions than the year before, and this
year was no exception. Both the quantity and the quality of proposals
we received were extraordinary. We only have 95 spaces in the schedule,
and we had to make many hard choices.

I hope you still decide to attend PyCon! It's an amazing conference,
and we still have several venues in which you could deliver your
material. Lightning talks are quick, five-minute talks on any topic,
and open spaces provide dedicated rooms for informal, unscheduled
proposals and discussions.

Many subjects that aren't good fits for formal, scheduled talks are
excellent subjects for open spaces! If you have a passion for your
topic, an open space is a great way to share your knowledge and passion
with others.

You can learn more at https://us.pycon.org/2017/about/

If you plan to come, you should register at
https://us.pycon.org/2017/registration/ as soon as possible. We have
a limited number of tickets, and we expect to sell out. Waiting to buy
tickets means you might not be able to come!

If you have any other questions, comments, or feedback, please feel
free to contact me (njl@njl.us), or the conference chair, Brandon Rhodes
(pycon.brandon@gmail.com).

On behalf of the PyCon staff, I want to thank you again for your
submission. You made our job of picking talks very hard, and the
conference will be better for it.

I hope to see you in Portland!

P.S. We'd like to have a collection of past proposals we can use in the
future to help potential PyCon speakers out. If you are amenable
to us publicly (and potentially anonymously) sharing your proposal, please
reply to this email and let me know!
