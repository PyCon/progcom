Welcome to PyCon Program Committee Talk Review!

If you aren't already subscribed to the pycon-pc mailing list, please take the
time to do that now!

Before reviewing proposals, please read http://www.njl.us/essays/pycon-process/.
It explains the screening criteria for the first stage of review in greater detail.

When you're ready to get started, please log in at http://progcom.njl.us/. 

At that website you will see a talk proposal, chosen randomly from the pool of
proposals that have the least reviews so far. Please review it based on the six
criteria provided, nominate the talk for special consideration if you think it
appropriate, and hit 'Save Vote' to save your vote.

After you submit your evaluation, you'll be able to see how others have voted. If you
disagree, feel free to start a discussion with other reviewers in the discussion box.
After you have saved your evaluation, you can move on to the next proposal. Please
vote for every proposal you are presented, in the state it is provided to you. We'll
keep track of proposals that change after you vote on them, and allow you to go back
and reevaluate them if necessary.

Right now we are in the screening stage of talk proposal evaluation. Later stages
of review will also occur on http://progcom.njl.us/, but we'll describe how those
will work in a future mailing list message.

Thank you so much for your help in making this year's PyCon program--we can't do
it without your time and thoughtful input. We hope you have fun reading these
talk proposals!
